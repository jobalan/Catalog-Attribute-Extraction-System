# Catalog Attribute Extraction System
## End-to-End Hybrid NLP Pipeline using Python, SQL Server, spaCy & Excel Delivery

---

### Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms receive **unstructured product descriptions** from multiple vendors.
To power **search, analytics, recommendations, and catalog consistency**, this data must be converted into **structured attributes** such as brand, price, material, warranty, etc.

This project builds a **production-style, SQL-first NLP system** that:
- Extracts **40 structured attributes** from raw text
- Uses a **hybrid NLP approach (Rules + spaCy NER)**
- Computes **confidence & quality metrics**
- Delivers a **business-ready Excel output**
- Supports **incremental ML upgrades & evaluation**

- ✅ Attribute-driven design (Excel controls extraction)  
- ✅ Hybrid NLP (spaCy NER + deterministic rules)  
- ✅ Confidence scoring & coverage metrics  
- ✅ Long-format scalable schema  
- ✅ Quantitative evaluation (Precision / Recall / F1)  
- ✅ Business-ready Excel delivery
